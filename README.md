# Converting integers to roman notation

Welcome to your interview assignment. Do you know roman digits?
They are quite easy.
* The M represents 1000
* The D represents 500
* The C represents 100
* The L represents 50
* The X represents 10
* The V represents 5
* The I represents 1

Integers are written according to these two rules: If a letter is
immediately followed by one of equal or lesser value, the two values
are added; thus, XX equals 20, XV equals 15, VI equals 6. If a letter
is immediately followed by one of greater value, the first is
subtracted from the second; thus, IV equals 4, XL equals 40, CM
equals 900.

Your assignment is to format the input integer, to a roman digit.
